# FetchURL

A Sublime Text 2/3 plugin to retrieve the contents of a URL, and install it
into a new buffer.  Currently I'm only supporting GET requests without
the added bells and whistles of submitting data or changing the request types.
This will perhaps be a later version.

## Installation

### For Linux
```shell
$ cd $HOME/.config/sublime_text_[23]/Packages && git clone https://github.com/cab105/fetchurl.git
```

### For MacOS X
```shell
$ cd $HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text [23]/Packages && git clone https://github.com/cab105/fetchurl.git
```

## Usage

Once installed, then type you OS's equivlant of ctl-shift-P to bring up the
command box, and type:
    urlfetch

Enter your URL, and then format the resulting buffer
